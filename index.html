							<h2>Neural Networking 3.0</h2>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, I had the privilege of joining a panel discussion hosted by the NYU Center 
								for Data Science. Upon arriving, I was thrilled to see that the panel consisted entirely 
								of women, comprising four talented professionals, each making significant strides in data 
								science and AI across sectors. What ensued over the next two hours was remarkable. While 
								I was looking forward to sharing my experiences as a data scientist, the discussion turned 
								out to be an incredibly enriching learning experience for me. I found myself both as a 
								speaker and as an attentive audience member, absorbing some truly invaluable insights 
								from my fellow panelists!<br/><br/>
								Each panelist offered such compelling narratives about embracing new technologies, 
								navigating challenges, and the importance of resilience in career pursuits. For me, 
								this experience also underscored the value of fostering a culture of active listening 
								and learning from peers. In today's world, where the art of listening seems underrated, 
								it's imperative that we seize all opportunities to grow from each other's perspectives. 
								My sincere thanks to NYU Center for Data Science for facilitating this enriching discussion, 
								and to my fellow panelists, here's to many more enlightening conversations ahead!

							<h2>Radio City India "On-air"</h2>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being 'on-air' is a unique experience - you're directly connecting with 
								people, often in real-time, with no room for retakes. It requires careful consideration of your 
								words and delivery while striving to offer insightful content for the audience. There are no 
								slides to refer to or pre-prepared answers; it's all about engaging in a genuine conversation. 
								To succeed, you must be authentic, well-versed in your subject matter, articulate, and attentive. 
								Listening to your host patiently and enjoying the moment is equally important â€“ it can be quite a 
								rollercoaster! It turned out to be more challenging than I initially anticipated, but my host 
								made it enjoyable and effortless.
								<br/><br/>
								During my conversation with Radio City India, India's first FM Radio, we delved into the realm of 
								Artificial Intelligence. We explored the true essence of AI, ways to stay informed as this 
								rapidly evolving field progresses, and the importance of being vigilant against the rising 
								tide of misinformation in the tech world. Of course, ChatGPT was a hot topic that everyone 
								wanted to delve into, and it certainly didn't go unnoticed!
								<br/><br/>
								If you want to chat about AI or dive into technical details of specific technologies, please 
								reach out. I'm enthusiastic about engaging in such conversations and would love to connect 
								with you!
